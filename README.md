## Compatibility
Supported as low as **Windows 10 2004** and as high as the **latest version of Windows 11** (excluding the preview version).

Can be used with third party themes to further customize DWM.

We do not modify the rendering logic of the application itself, which is completely different from the logic of MicaForEveryone and therefore maximizes compatibility with third-party programs.

Compatible with [ExplorerBlurMica](https://github.com/Maplespe/ExplorerBlurMica), works better together.

Compatible with [TranslucentFlyouts](https://github.com/ALTaleX531/TranslucentFlyouts). (**It should be noted that even though this project is compatible with TF, EBMv2 is not fully compatible with TFv2**)

## Language files
We offer basic languages English and Simplified Chinese.
If you would like to help us translate into other languages, please see below for language file formats.

1. First, you need to fork this repository and clone it locally.
2. Open the "`Languagefiles`" folder and select an existing language such as "`en-US.xml`" and make a copy.
3. Rename the code to the name of the [target language](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/intl/locale-names) and open the xml file in your favorite text editor.
4. In the second line, in the "`local`" field, change it to your target language code, which should be the same as the filename (without the .xml extension).
5. You can put your name in the "`author`" field.
6. Next, please translate the field values in the xml format (be careful not to translate the field names) The correct format is:`<config>Config</config>` to `<config>xxxx</config>`.
7. Save your file when finished and copy it to the "data\lang" directory in the folder where the DWMBlurGlass.exe program is located.
8. Next, open DWMBlurGlass.exe and test the language file to see if it works correctly. If it doesn't, check the language code settings and check that the file conforms to the xml format specification.
9. Finally, commit the file to your own forked repository and send pull requests to the main branch of the project.
10. After the request is approved, your file will be released with a future software update.
